max_parallel_workers (integer)
Sets the maximum number of workers that the system can support for parallel queries. The default value is 8. When increasing or decreasing this value, consider also adjusting max_parallel_workers_per_gather. Also, note that a setting for this value which is higher than max_worker_processes will have no effect, since parallel workers are taken from the pool of worker processes established by that setting.
